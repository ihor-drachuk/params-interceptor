# Params interceptor

Shows with what parameters the application is launched.

Instructions:
1. Rename target (studied) exe file: "file.exe" -> "file.exe_orig"
2. Download [Interceptor](https://github.com/ihor-drachuk/params-interceptor/releases/download/v0.1/interceptor_v0.1.exe) and put it inplace of the original file (in this example name it "file.exe")
3. Use your software as always; expect "interceptor-*.txt" logs on Desktop
